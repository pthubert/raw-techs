   <abstract>
      <t>   This document presents a series of recent technologies that are 
      capable of time synchronization and scheduling of transmission, making 
      them suitable to carry time-sensitive flows with requirements of both
      reliable delivery in bounded time, and availability at all times,
      regardless of packet transmission or individual equipement failures.

   <section title="Introduction">
   <t>
   When used in math or philosophy, the term "deterministic" generally refers to 
   a perfection where all aspect are understood and predictable. A perfectly
   Deterministic Network would ensure that every packet reach its destination
   following a predetermined path along a predefined schedule to be delivered at
   the exact due time. In a real and imperfect world, a Deterministic Network 
   must highly predictable, which is a combination of reliability and
   availability. On the one hand the network must be reliable, meaning that it
   will perform as expected for all packets and in particular that it will
   always deliver the packet at the destination in due time. On the other hand,
   the network must be available, meaning that it is resilient to any single
   outage, whether the cause is a software, a hardware or a transmission issue. 
   
   </t>
   <t>
   
   RAW (Reliable and Available Wireless) is an effort to provide Deterministic
   Networking on across a path that include a a wireless physical layer.          
   Making Wireless Reliable and Available is even more challenging than it is
   with wires, due to the numerous causes of loss in transmission that add up 
   to the congestion losses and the delays caused by overbooked shared resources.
   In order to maintain a similar quality of service along a multihop path that 
   is composed of wired and wireless hops, additional methods that are specific
   to wireless must be leveraged to combat the sources of loss that are also
   specific to wireless.
   
   </t>
   <t>

   Such wireless-specific methods include per-hop retransmissions (HARQ) and
   P2MP overhearing whereby multiple receivers are scheduled to receive the same
   transmission, which balances the adverse effects of the transmission losses
   that are eperienced when a radio is used as pure P2P.

   <section title="On Scheduling">
   <t>
       
   The operations of a Deterministic Network often rely on precisely
   applying a tight schedule, in order to avoid collision loss and guarantee
   the worst case time of delivery . To achieve this, there must be a shared
   sense of time throughout the network. The sense of time is 
   usually provided by the lower layer and is not in scope for RAW. 
   </t>
   
   
   <section anchor="wbenef" title="Benefits of Scheduling on Wires">
   <t>
   
   A network is reliable when the statistical effects that affect the packet 
   transmission are eliminated. This involves maintaining at all time the amount
   of critical packets within the physical capabilities of the hardware and that 
   of the radio medium. This is achieved by controlling the use of time-shared
   resources such as CPUs and buffers, by shaping the flows and by scheduling
   the time of transmission of the packets that compose the flow at every hop.
   
   </t>
   <t>

   Equipment failure, such as an access point rebooting, a broken radio adapter,
   or a permanent obstacle to the transmission, is a secondary source of packet
   loss. When a breakage occurs, multiple packets are lost in a row before the
   flows are rerouted or the system may recover. This is not acceptable for
   critical applications such as related to safety. A typical process control
   loop will tolerate an occasional packet loss, but a loss of several packets
   in a row will cause an emergency stop (e.g., after 4 packets lost, within a
   period of 1 second).
   
   </t>
   <t>
      
   Network Availability is obtained by making the transmission resilient against
   hardware failures and radio transmission losses due to uncontrolled events
   such as co-channel interferers, multipath fading or moving obstacles. The
   best results are typically achieved by pseudo randomly cumulating all forms
   of diversity, in the spatial domain with replication and elimination, in the
   time domain with ARQ and diverse scheduled transmissions, and in the
   frequency domain with frequency hopping or channel hopping between frames. 
   
   </t>
   </section><!-- Benefits of Scheduling on Wires -->
   
   <section anchor="wessbenef" title="Benefits of Scheduling on Wireless">

   <t>
   In addition to the benefits listed in <xref target="wbenef"/>, scheduling
   transmissions provides specific value to the wireless medium.
   </t>
   <t>
   On the one hand, scheduling avoids collisions between scheduled transmissions
   and can ensure both time and frequency diversity between retries in order
   to defeat co-channel interference from uncontroller transmitters as well as
   multipath fading. Transmissions can be scheduled on multiple channels in
   parallel, which enables to use the full available spectrum while avoiding the
   hidden terminal problem, e.g., when the next packet in a same flow interferes
   on a same channel with the previous one that progressed a few hops farther.
   </t>
   <t>   
   On the other hand, scheduling optimizes the bandwidth usage: compared to
   classical Collision Avoidance techniques, there is no blank time related to
   inter-frame space (IFS) and exponential back-off in scheduled operations.
   A minimal Clear Channel Assessment may be needed to comply with the local
   regulations such as ETSI 300-328, but that will not detect a collision when
   the senders are synchronized.
   And because scheduling allows a time sharing operation, there is no limit to
   the ratio of isolated critical traffic.
   </t>
   <t>   
   Finally, scheduling plays a critical role to save energy. In IOT, energy is
   the foremost concern, and synchronizing sender and listener enables to
   maintain them in deep sleep at all times when there is no scheduled
   transmission. This avoids idle listening and long preambles and enables long
   sleep periods between traffic and resynchronization, allowing 
   battery-operated nodes to operate in a mesh topology for multiple years.
