      <t>   This document presents a series of recent technologies that are 
      capable of time synchronization and scheduling of transmission, making 
      them suitable to carry time-sensitive flows with requirements of both
      reliable delivery in bounded time, and availability at all times,

   <section title="Introduction">
   <t>
   When used in math or philosophy, the term "deterministic" generally refers to 
   a perfection where all aspect are understood and predictable. A perfectly
   Deterministic Network would ensure that every packet reach its destination
   following a predetermined path along a predefined schedule to be delivered at
   the exact due time. In a real and imperfect world, a Deterministic Network 
   must highly predictable, which is a combination of reliability and
   availability. On the one hand the network must be reliable, meaning that it
   will perform as expected for all packets and in particular that it will
   always deliver the packet at the destination in due time. On the other hand,
   the network must be available, meaning that it is resilient to any single
   outage, whether the cause is a software, a hardware or a transmission issue. 
   
   </t>
   <t>
   
   RAW (Reliable and Available Wireless) is an effort to provide Deterministic
   Networking on across a path that include a wireless physical layer.          
   Making Wireless Reliable and Available is even more challenging than it is
   with wires, due to the numerous causes of loss in transmission that add up 
   to the congestion losses and the delays caused by overbooked shared resources.
   In order to maintain a similar quality of service along a multihop path that 
   is composed of wired and wireless hops, additional methods that are specific
   to wireless must be leveraged to combat the sources of loss that are also
   specific to wireless.
   
   </t>
   <t>

   Such wireless-specific methods include per-hop retransmissions (HARQ) and
   P2MP overhearing whereby multiple receivers are scheduled to receive the same
   transmission, which balances the adverse effects of the transmission losses
   that are experienced when a radio is used as pure P2P.

   <section title="Terminology">
   <t>This specification uses several terms that are uncommon on protocols
   that ensure bets effort transmissions for stochastics flows, such as found in

       of retries within a bounded time may be used over a wireless link and yet

   <section title="On Scheduling">
   <t>
       
   The operations of a Deterministic Network often rely on precisely
   applying a tight schedule, in order to avoid collision loss and guarantee
   the worst-case time of delivery. To achieve this, there must be a shared
   sense of time throughout the network. The sense of time is 
   usually provided by the lower layer and is not in scope for RAW. 
   </t>
   
   
   <section anchor="wbenef" title="Benefits of Scheduling on Wires">
   <t>
   
   A network is reliable when the statistical effects that affect the packet 
   transmission are eliminated. This involves maintaining at all time the amount
   of critical packets within the physical capabilities of the hardware and that 
   of the radio medium. This is achieved by controlling the use of time-shared
   resources such as CPUs and buffers, by shaping the flows and by scheduling
   the time of transmission of the packets that compose the flow at every hop.
   
   </t>
   <t>

   Equipment failure, such as an access point rebooting, a broken radio adapter,
   or a permanent obstacle to the transmission, is a secondary source of packet
   loss. When a breakage occurs, multiple packets are lost in a row before the
   flows are rerouted or the system may recover. This is not acceptable for
   critical applications such as related to safety. A typical process control
   loop will tolerate an occasional packet loss, but a loss of several packets
   in a row will cause an emergency stop (e.g., after 4 packets lost, within a
   period of 1 second).
   
   </t>
   <t>
      
   Network Availability is obtained by making the transmission resilient against
   hardware failures and radio transmission losses due to uncontrolled events
   such as co-channel interferers, multipath fading or moving obstacles. The
   best results are typically achieved by pseudo randomly cumulating all forms
   of diversity, in the spatial domain with replication and elimination, in the
   time domain with ARQ and diverse scheduled transmissions, and in the
   frequency domain with frequency hopping or channel hopping between frames. 
   
   </t>
   </section><!-- Benefits of Scheduling on Wires -->
   
   <section anchor="wessbenef" title="Benefits of Scheduling on Wireless">

   <t>
   In addition to the benefits listed in <xref target="wbenef"/>, scheduling
   transmissions provides specific value to the wireless medium.
   </t>
   <t>
   On the one hand, scheduling avoids collisions between scheduled transmissions
   and can ensure both time and frequency diversity between retries in order
   to defeat co-channel interference from un-controlled transmitters as well as
   multipath fading. Transmissions can be scheduled on multiple channels in
   parallel, which enables to use the full available spectrum while avoiding the
   hidden terminal problem, e.g., when the next packet in a same flow interferes
   on a same channel with the previous one that progressed a few hops farther.
   </t>
   <t>   
   On the other hand, scheduling optimizes the bandwidth usage: compared to
   classical Collision Avoidance techniques, there is no blank time related to
   inter-frame space (IFS) and exponential back-off in scheduled operations.
   A minimal Clear Channel Assessment may be needed to comply with the local
   regulations such as ETSI 300-328, but that will not detect a collision when
   the senders are synchronized.
   And because scheduling allows a time-sharing operation, there is no limit to
   the ratio of isolated critical traffic.
   </t>
   <t>   
   Finally, scheduling plays a critical role to save energy. In IOT, energy is
   the foremost concern, and synchronizing sender and listener enables to
   always maintain them in deep sleep when there is no scheduled
   transmission. This avoids idle listening and long preambles and enables long
   sleep periods between traffic and resynchronization, allowing 
   battery-operated nodes to operate in a mesh topology for multiple years.

   <section title="IEEE 802 standards">
   <t>
   With an active portfolio of nearly 1,300 standards and projects under development, IEEE is a leading developer of industry standards in a broad range of technologies that drive the functionality, capabilities, and interoperability of products and services, transforming how people live, work, and communicate.
   </t>   
      
   <t> 
   The IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee (SC) develops and maintains networking standards and recommended practices for local, metropolitan, and other area networks, using an open and accredited process, and advocates them on a global basis. The most widely used standards are for Ethernet, Bridging and Virtual Bridged LANs Wireless LAN, Wireless PAN, Wireless MAN, Wireless Coexistence, Media Independent Handover Services, and Wireless RAN. An individual Working Group provides the focus for each area. Standards produced by the IEEE 802 SC are freely available from the IEEE GET Program after they have been published in PDF for six months.

        	The IEEE 802.11 LAN standards define the underlying MAC and PHY layers for the Wi-Fi technology. Wi-Fi/802.11 is one of the most successful wireless technologies, supporting many application domains. While previous 802.11 generations, such as 802.11n and 802.11ac, have focused mainly on improving peak throughput, more recent generations are also considering other performance vectors, such as efficiency enhancements for dense environments in 802.11ax, and latency and support for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) capabilities in 802.11be.
        	</t>
        	<t>
        	IEEE 802.11 already supports some 802.1 TSN standards  and it is undergoing efforts to support for other 802.1 TSN capabilities required to address the use cases that require time synchronization and timeliness (bounded latency) guarantees with high reliability and availability. The IEEE 802.11 working group has been working in collaboration with the IEEE 802.1 group for several years extending 802.1 features over 802.11. As with any wireless media, 802.11 imposes new constraints and restrictions to TSN-grade QoS, and tradeoffs between latency and reliability guarantees must be considered as well as managed deployment requirements. An overview of 802.1 TSN capabilities and their extensions to 802.11 are discussed in <xref target="Cavalcanti_2019"/>.

        	<section title="General Characteristics"> 
        		<t>
        			The next generation Wi-Fi (Wi-Fi 6) is based on the IEEE802.11ax amendment <xref target="IEEE80211ax"/>, which includes new capabilities to increase efficiency, control and reduce latency. Some of the new features include higher order 1024-QAM modulation, support for uplink multi-user MIMO, OFDMA, trigger-based access and Target Wake time (TWT) for enhanced power savings. The OFDMA mode and trigger-based access enable scheduled operation, which is a key capability required to support deterministic latency and reliability for time-sensitive flows. 802.11ax can operate in up to 160 MHz channels and it includes support for operation in the new 6 GHz band, which is expected to be open to unlicensed use by the FCC and other regulatory agencies worldwide. 
        			</t>
        		<section title="Multi-User OFDMA and Trigger-based Scheduled Access">
        			<t>
        				802.11ax introduced a new orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) mode in which multiple users can be scheduled across the frequency domain. In this mode, the Access Point (AP) can initiate multi-user (MU) Uplink (UL) transmissions in the same PHY Protocol Data Unit (PPDU) by sending a trigger frame. This centralized scheduling capability gives the AP much more control of the channel, and it can remove contention between devices for uplink transmissions, therefore reducing the randomness caused by CSMA-based access between stations. The AP can also transmit simultaneously to multiple users in the downlink direction by using a Downlink (DL) MU OFDMA PPDU. In order to initiate a contention free Transmission Opportunity (TXOP) using the OFDMA mode, the AP still follows the typical listen before talk procedure to acquire the medium, which ensures interoperability and compliance with unlicensed band access rules. However, 802.11ax also includes a multi-user Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (MU-EDCA) capability, which allows the AP to get higher channel access priority.

        		<section title="Improved PHY Robustness">
        			<t>
        				The 802.11ax PHY can operate with 0.8, 1.6 or 3.2 microsecond guard interval (GI). The larger GI options provide better protection against multipath, which is expected to be a challenge in industrial environments. The possibility to operate with smaller resource units (e.g. 2 MHz) enabled by OFDMA also helps reduce noise power and improve SNR, leading to better packet error rate (PER) performance. 
        			</t>
        			<t>
        				802.11ax supports beamforming as in 802.11ac, but introduces UL MU MIMO, which helps improve reliability. The UL MU MIMO capability is also enabled by the trigger based access operation in 802.11ax.

Given the amount of new spectrum available as well as the fact that no legacy 802.11 device (prior 802.11ax) will be able to operate in this new band, 802.11ax operation in this new band can be even more efficient.

        		TSN capabilities, as defined by the IEEE 802.1 TSN standards, provide the underlying mechanism for supporting deterministic flows in a Local Area Network (LAN). The 802.11 working group has already incorporated support for several TSN capabilities, so that time-sensitive flow can experience precise time synchronization and timeliness when operating over 802.11 links. TSN capabilities supported over 802.11 (which also extends to 802.11ax), include:

        			The exiting 802.11 TSN capabilities listed above, and the 802.11ax OFDMA and scheduled access provide a new set of tools to better server time-sensitive flows. However, it is important to understand the tradeoffs and constraints associated with such capabilities, as well as redundancy and diversity mechanisms that can be used to provide more predictable and reliable performance.

        	<section title=" 802.11 Managed network operation and admission control"> 
        	<t>
        		Time-sensitive applications and TSN standards are expected to operate under a managed network (e.g. industrial/enterprise network). Thus, the Wi-Fi operation must also be carefully managed and integrated with the overall TSN management framework, as defined in the IEEE Std. 802.1Qcc specification <xref target="IEEE8021Qcc"/>.

        	<t>
        		Existing traffic stream identification, configuration and admission control procedures defined in IEEE Std. 802.11 QoS mechanism can be re-used.

        	<section title="Scheduling for bounded latency and diversity">
        	<t>
        		As discussed earlier, the 802.11ax OFDMA mode introduces the possibility of assigning different RUs (frequency resources) to users within a PPDU. Several RU sizes are defined in the specification (26, 52, 106, 242, 484, 996 subcarriers). In addition, the AP can also decide on MCS and grouping of users within a given OFMDA PPDU. Such flexibility can be leveraged to support time-sensitive applications with bounded latency, especially in a managed network where stations can be configured to operate under the control of the AP.
        	</t>
        	<t>
        		As shown in <xref target="Cavalcanti_2019"/>, it is possible to achieve latencies in the order of 1msec with high reliability in an interference free environment. Obviously, there are latency, reliability and capacity tradeoffs to be considered. For instance, smaller Resource Units (RU)s result in longer transmission durations, which may impact the minimal latency that can be achieved, but the contention latency and randomness elimination due to multi-user transmission is a major benefit of the OFDMA mode.
        	</t>
        	<t>
        		The flexibility to dynamically assign RUs to each transmission also enables the AP to provide frequency diversity, which can help increase reliability.

   The IEEE802.15.4 Task Group has been driving the development of low-power 
   low-cost radio technology. 
   The IEEE802.15.4 physical layer has been designed to support demanding 
   low-power scenarios targeting the use of unlicensed bands, both the 2.4 GHz 
   and sub GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) bands. This has imposed 
   requirements in terms of frame size, data rate and bandwidth to achieve 
   reduced collision probability, reduced packet error rate, and acceptable 
   range with limited transmission power. The PHY layer supports frames of up to
   127 bytes. The Medium Access Control (MAC) sublayer overhead is in the order
   of 10-20 bytes, leaving about 100 bytes to the upper layers. IEEE802.15.4 
   uses spread spectrum modulation such as the Direct Sequence Spread 
   Spectrum (DSSS).

   At the IETF, the 6TiSCH Working Group (WG) <xref target="TiSCH"/> deals with
   best effort operation of IPv6 <xref target="RFC8200"/> over TSCH. 6TiSCH has 
   enabled distributed scheduling to exploit the deterministic 
   access capabilities provided by TSCH. The group designed the essential 
   mechanisms to enable the management plane operation while ensuring IPv6 is 
   supported. Yet the charter did not focus to providing a solution to establish
   end to end Tracks while meeting quality of service requirements. 6TiSCH, 
   through the RFC8480 <xref target="RFC8480"/> defines the 6P protocol which 
   provides a pairwise negotiation mechanism to the control plane operation. 
   The protocol supports agreement on a schedule between neighbors, enabling 
   distributed scheduling. 
   6P goes hand-in-hand with a Scheduling Function (SF), the policy that decides
   how to maintain cells and trigger 6P transactions. The Minimal Scheduling 
   Function (MSF) <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-msf"/> is the default SF defined
   by the 6TiSCH WG; other standardized SFs can be defined in the future. 
   MSF extends the minimal schedule configuration, and is used to add 
   child-parent links according to the traffic load.

   This schedule represents the possible communications of a node with its
   neighbors, and is managed by a Scheduling Function such as The Minimal
   Scheduling Function (MSF)  <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-msf"/>. Each cell in
   the schedule is identified by its slotoffset and channeloffset coordinates. A
   cell's timeslot offset indicates its position in time, relative to the
   beginning of the slotframe. A cell's channel offset is an index which maps to
   a frequency at each iteration of the slotframe. Each packet exchanged between
   neighbors happens within one cell. An Absolute Slot Number (ASN) indicates
   the number of slots elapsed since the network started. It increments at every
   slot. This is a 5 byte counter that can support networks running for more
   than 300 years without wrapping (assuming a 10 ms timeslot). Channel hopping
   provides increased reliability to multi-path fading and external
   interference. It is handled by TSCH through a channel hopping sequence

    Nodes in a TSCH network are tightly synchronized. This enables to build the
    slotted structure and ensure efficient utilization of resources thanks to
    proper scheduling policies. Scheduling is a key to orchestrate the resources
    that different nodes in a Track or a path are using. Slotframes can be 
    split in resource blocks reserving the needed capacity to certain flows.
    Periodic and bursty traffic can be handled independently in the schedule,
    using active and reactive policies and taking advantage of overprovisionned
    cells to measu reth excursion. Along a Track, resource blocks can be chained
    so nodes in previous hops transmit their data before the next packet comes.
    This provides a tight control to latency along a Track. Collision loss is
    avoided for best effort traffic by overprovisionning resources, giving time
    to the management plane of the network to dedicate more resources if needed.

   In a controlled environment, a 6TiSCH device usually does not place a request
   for bandwidth between itself and another device in the network. Rather, an
   Operation Control System (OCS) invoked through an Human/Machine Interface
   (HMI) iprovides the Traffic Specification, in particular in terms of latency
   and reliability, and the end nodes, to a PCE. With this, the PCE computes a
   Track between the end nodes and provisions every hop in the Track with
   per-flow state that describes the per-hop operation for a given packet, the
   corresponding timeSlots, and the flow identification to recognize which packet
   is placed in which Track, sort out duplicates, etc...
   </t>
   <t>
   For a static configuration that serves a certain purpose for a long period of
   time, it is expected that a node will be provisioned in one shot with a full
   schedule, which incorporates the aggregation of its behavior for multiple
   Tracks. The 6TiSCH Architecture expects that the programing of the schedule
   is done over COAP as discussed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-coap">"6TiSCH
   Resource Management and Interaction using CoAP"</xref>.
   </t>
   <t>
   But an Hybrid mode may be required as well whereby a single Track is added,
   modified, or removed, for instance if it appears that a Track does not 
   perform as expected for, say, PDR.
   For that case, the expectation is that a protocol that flows along a Track
   (to be), in a fashion similar to classical Traffic Engineering (TE)
   <xref target="CCAMP"/>, may be used to update the state in the devices. 
   6TiSCH provides means for a device to negotiate a timeSlot with
   a neighbor, but in general that flow was not designed and no protocol was
   selected and it is expected that DetNet will determine the appropriate 
   end-to-end protocols to be used in that case.

   For packets that are routed by a PCE along a Track, the tuple formed by the
   IPv6 source address and a local RPLInstanceID is tagged in the packets
   to identify uniquely the Track and associated transmit bundle of timeSlots.
   </t>
   <t>
   It results that the tagging that is used for a DetNet flow outside the 
   6TiSCH LLN MUST be swapped into 6TiSCH formats and back as the packet 
   enters and then leaves the 6TiSCH network.

   <t>6TiSCH expects elimination and replication of packets along a complex 
   Track, but has no position about how the sequence numbers would be tagged in 
   the packet. 
   </t>
   <t>
   As it goes, 6TiSCH expects that timeSlots corresponding to copies
   of a same packet along a Track are correlated by configuration, and does not 
   need to process the sequence numbers.
   </t>
   <t>
   The semantics of the configuration MUST enable correlated timeSlots to be
   grouped for transmit (and respectively receive) with a 'OR' relations, 
   and then a 'AND' relation MUST be configurable between groups. 
   The semantics is that if the transmit (and respectively receive) operation
   succeeded in one timeSlot in a 'OR' group, then all the other timeSLots in 
   the group are ignored. 
   Now, if there are at least two groups, the 'AND' relation between the groups 
   indicates that one operation must succeed in each of the groups. 
   </t>
   <t>
   On the transmit side, timeSlots provisioned for retries along a same branch
   of a Track are placed a same 'OR' group. The 'OR' relation indicates that if
   a transmission is acknowledged, then further transmissions SHOULD NOT be 
   attempted for timeSlots in that group. There are as many 'OR' groups as 
   there are branches of the Track departing from this node. Different 'OR' groups
   are programmed for the purpose of replication, each group corresponding to 
   one branch of the Track. The 'AND' relation between the groups indicates that
   transmission over any of branches MUST be attempted regardless of whether a
   transmission succeeded in another branch. It is also possible to place cells
   to different next-hop routers in a same 'OR' group. This allows to route along
   multi-path Tracks, trying one next-hop and then another only if sending to the 
   first fails.
   </t>
   <t>
   On the receive side, all timeSlots are programmed in a same 'OR' group.
   Retries of a same copy as well as converging branches for elimination
   are converged, meaning that the first successful reception is enough and that
   all the other timeSlots can be ignored.

      6TiSCH supports a mixed model of centralized routes and distributed routes.
      Centralized routes can for example be computed by a entity such as a Path
      Computation element (PCE) <xref target="PCE"/>.
      Distributed routes are computed by <xref target="RFC6550">RPL</xref>.
      </t>
      <t>
      Both methods may inject routes in the Routing Tables of the 6TiSCH routers.
      In either case, each route is associated with a 6TiSCH topology that can
      be a RPL Instance topology or a Track. The 6TiSCH topology is
      indexed by a Instance ID, in a format that reuses the RPLInstanceID as
      defined in RPL.
      </t>
      <t>
      Both RPL and PCE rely on shared sources such as policies to define Global
      and Local RPLInstanceIDs that can be used by either method. It is possible
      for centralized and distributed routing to share a same topology.
      Generally they will operate in different slotFrames, and centralized
      routes will be used for scheduled traffic and will have precedence over
      distributed routes in case of conflict between the slotFrames.

      <section anchor="slotFrames" title="SlotFrames and Priorities">
         <t>A slotFrame is the base object that a PCE needs to manipulate 
         to program a schedule into an LLN node. Elaboration on that concept
         can be fond in section "SlotFrames and Priorities" of 
         <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture"/>

         <t>
         IEEE802.15.4 TSCH avoids contention on the medium by formatting time
         and frequencies in cells of transmission of equal duration. 
         In order to describe that formatting of time and frequencies, the
         6TiSCH architecture defines a global concept that is called a Channel
         Distribution and Usage (CDU) matrix; a CDU matrix is a matrix of
         cells with an height equal to the number of available channels
         (indexed by ChannelOffsets) and a width (in timeSlots) that is the
         period of the network scheduling operation (indexed by slotOffsets) for
         that CDU matrix. The size of a cell is a timeSlot duration, and 
         values  of 10 to 15 milliseconds are typical in 802.15.4 TSCH to 
         accommodate for the transmission of a frame and an ack, including the 
         security validation on the receive side which may take up to a few 
         milliseconds on some device architecture.
         </t>
         <t>
         The frequency used by a cell in the matrix rotates in a pseudo-random 
         fashion, from an initial position at an epoch time, as the matrix
         iterates over and over.
         </t>
         <t>
         A CDU matrix is computed by the PCE, but unallocated timeSlots may be
         used opportunistically by the nodes for classical best effort IP 
         traffic. The PCE has precedence in the allocation in case of a conflict.
         </t>
         <t>
         In a given network, there might be multiple CDU matrices that operate
         with different width, so they have different durations and represent
         different periodic operations.
         It is recommended that all CDU matrices in a 6TiSCH domain operate with
         the same cell duration and are aligned, so as to reduce the
         chances of interferences from slotted-aloha operations.
         The PCE MUST compute the CDU matrices and shared that knowledge with
         all the nodes. The matrices are used in particular to define slotFrames.
          </t>
          <t>
          A slotFrame is a MAC-level abstraction that is common to all nodes and
          contains a series of timeSlots of equal length and precedence.
          It is characterized by a slotFrame_ID, and a slotFrame_size.
          A slotFrame aligns to a CDU matrix for its parameters, such as number
          and duration of timeSlots.
          </t>
          <t>
          Multiple slotFrames can coexist in a node schedule, i.e., a node can
          have multiple activities scheduled in different slotFrames, based on
          the precedence of the 6TiSCH topologies. The slotFrames may be
          aligned to different CDU matrices and thus have different width.
          There is typically one slotFrame for scheduled traffic that has the
          highest precedence and one or more slotFrame(s) for RPL traffic.
          The timeSlots in the slotFrame are indexed by the SlotOffset;
          the first cell is at SlotOffset 0.
          </t>
         <t>
         The 6TiSCH architecture introduces the concept of chunks
         (<xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture"/>) to operate
         such spectrum distribution for a whole group of cells at a time.
         The CDU matrix is formatted into a set of chunks, each of them
         identified uniquely by a chunk-ID. 
         The PCE MUST compute the partitioning of CDU matrices into chunks and
         shared that knowledge with all the nodes in a 6TiSCH network.

            The appropriation of a chunk can be requested explicitly by the
            PCE to any node. After a successful appropriation, the PCE owns the
            cells in that chunk, and may use them as hard cells to set up Tracks. Then again, 6TiSCH did not propose a method for chunk 
            definition and a protocol for appropriation. This is to be done 
            at PAW.

   <section anchor="Tracks" title="6TiSCH Tracks">
   
   <t>
   A Track at 6TiSCH is the application to wireless of the concept of a path in
   the Detnet architecture <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture"/>.
   A Track can follow a simple sequence of relay nodes or can be structured as a
   more complex destination oriented directed acyclic graph (DODAG) to a unicast 
   destination. Along a Track, 6TiSCH nodes reserve the resources to enable the
   efficient transmission of packets while aiming to optimize certain properties
   such as reliability and ensure small jitter or bounded latency. The Track 
   structure enables Layer-2 forwarding schemes, reducing the overhead of taking
   routing decisions at the Layer-3.  
   </t>
   <t>
   Serial Tracks can be understood as the concatenation of cells or bundles
   along a routing path from a node towards a destination. The serial Track
   concept is analogous to the circuit concept where resources are chained
   through the multi-hop topology. For example, A bundle of Tx Cells in a
   particular node is paired to a bundle of Rx Cells in the next hop node
   following a routing path. 
   </t>
   <t>
   whereas scheduling ensures reliable delivery in bounded time along any Track,
   high availability requires the application of PAREO functions along a more
   complex DODAG Track structure. A DODAG has forking and joining nodes where 
   the concepts such as Replication and Elimination can be exploited. 
   Spatial redundancy increases the oveall energy consumption in the network but
   improves significantly the availability of the network as well as the packet
   delivery ratio. 

   A Track may also branch off and rejoin, for the purpose of the so-called
   Packet Replication and Elimination (PRE), over non congruent branches.
   PRE may be used to complement layer-2 Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) and
   and receiver-end Ordering to form the PAREO functions. PAREO functions enable
   to meet industrial expectations in Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) within bounded
   delivery time over a Track that includes wireless links, even when the Track
   extends beyond the 6TiSCH network.

      <t>In the example above, a Track is laid out from a field device in a 
      6TiSCH network to an IoT gateway that is located on a IEEE802.1 TSN
      backbone. 
      </t>
      <t>
      The Replication function in the field device sends a copy of each packet 
      over two different branches, and a PCE schedules each hop of both branches
      so that the two 
      copies arrive in due time at the gateway. In case of a loss on one branch, 
      hopefully the other copy of the packet still makes it in due time. If two
      copies make it to the IoT gateway, the Elimination function in the gateway
      ignores the extra packet and presents only one copy to upper layers.
      </t>
      <t>
      At each 6TiSCH hop along the Track, the PCE may schedule more than one
      timeSlot for a packet, so as to support Layer-2 retries (ARQ). It is also
      possible that the field device only uses the second branch if sending over
      the first branch fails. 
      </t>
      <t>
      In current deployments, a TSCH Track does not necessarily support PRE but
      is systematically multi-path. This means that a Track is scheduled so as
      to ensure that each hop has at least two forwarding solutions, and the
      forwarding decision is to try the preferred one and use the other in
      case of Layer-2 transmission failure as detected by ARQ.
         </t>
           <t>Methods to implement complex Tracks are described
   in <xref target="I-D.papadopoulos-paw-pre-reqs"/> and complemented by 
   extensions to the RPL routing protocol in 
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-nsa-extension"/> for best effort traffic, but a
   centralized routing technique such as promoted in DetNet is still missing.

         Section "Schedule Management Mechanisms" of the 6TiSCH architecture
         describes 4 paradigms to manage the TSCH schedule of the LLN nodes: 
         Static Scheduling, neighbor-to-neighbor Scheduling, remote monitoring
         and scheduling management, and Hop-by-hop scheduling.
         The Track operation for DetNet corresponds to a remote monitoring and
         scheduling management by a PCE.

      Early work at 6TiSCH on a data model and a protocol to program the
      schedule in the 6TiSCH device was never concluded as the group focussed on
      best effort traffic. This work would be revived by PAW:
      <list>
         <t>
            The 6top interface document
            <xref target="RFC8480"/>
            (to be reopened at PAW) was intended to
            specify the generic data model that can be used to monitor and 
            manage
            resources of the 6top sublayer. Abstract methods were suggested 
            for use
            by a management entity in the device. The data model also enables
            remote control operations on the 6top sublayer.

         <t>
            <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-coap"/> 
            (to be reopened at RAW) was intended to define a mapping of the 6top
            set of commands, which is described in RFC 8480, to CoAP resources.
            This allows an entity to interact with the 6top layer of a node that
            is multiple hops away in a RESTful fashion.
         </t>
         <t>
            <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-coap"/> also defined a basic set CoAP
            resources and associated RESTful access methods
            (GET/PUT/POST/DELETE). The payload (body) of the CoAP messages
            is encoded using the CBOR format.
            The PCE commands are expected to be issued directly as CoAP requests
            or to be mapped back and forth into CoAP by a gateway function at 
            the edge of the 6TiSCH network. For instance, it is possible that a
            mapping entity on the backbone transforms a non-CoAP protocol such 
            as PCEP into the RESTful interfaces that the 6TiSCH devices support.

   <section  anchor="fwd" title="Track Forwarding">
      <t>
         By forwarding, this specification means the per-packet operation that 
         allows to deliver a packet to a next hop or an upper layer in this node.
         Forwarding is based on pre-existing state that was installed as a 
         result of the routing computation of a Track by a PCE. 
         The 6TiSCH architecture supports three different forwarding model, 
         G-MPLS Track Forwarding (TF), 6LoWPAN Fragment Forwarding (FF) and 
         IPv6 Forwarding (6F) which is the classical IP operation.
         The DetNet case relates to the Track Forwarding operation under the
         control of a PCE.
      </t>
         <t>
            A Track is a unidirectional path between a source and a destination.
            In a Track cell, the normal operation of IEEE802.15.4
            Automatic Repeat-reQuest (ARQ) usually happens, though the
            acknowledgment may be omitted in some cases, for instance if there
            is no scheduled cell for a retry.
         </t>
         <t>
            Track Forwarding is the simplest and fastest. A bundle of cells set
            to receive (RX-cells) is uniquely paired to a bundle of cells that
            are set to transmit (TX-cells), representing a layer-2 forwarding
            state that can be used regardless of the network layer protocol.
            This model can effectively be seen as a Generalized Multi-protocol
            Label Switching (G-MPLS) operation in that the information used to

            switch a frame is not an explicit label, but rather related to other
            properties of the way the packet was received, a particular cell in
            the case of 6TiSCH.
            As a result, as long as the TSCH MAC (and Layer-2 security) accepts
            a frame, that frame can be switched regardless of the protocol,
            whether this is an IPv6 packet, a 6LoWPAN fragment, or a frame from
            an alternate protocol such as WirelessHART or ISA100.11a.
         </t>
         <t>
            A data frame that is forwarded along a Track normally has
            a destination MAC address that is set to broadcast -
            or a multicast address depending on MAC support.
            This way, the MAC layer in the intermediate nodes accepts the
            incoming frame and 6top switches it without incurring a change in
            the MAC header. In the case of IEEE802.15.4, this means effectively
            broadcast, so that along the Track the short address for the
            destination of the frame is set to 0xFFFF.
         </t>
         <t>
            A Track is thus formed end-to-end as a succession of paired bundles,
            a receive bundle from the previous hop and   a transmit bundle to
            the next hop along the Track, and a cell in such a bundle belongs to
            at most one Track.
            For a given iteration of the device schedule, the effective channel
            of the cell is obtained by adding a pseudo-random number to the
            channelOffset of the cell, which results in a rotation of the
            frequency that used for transmission.
            The bundles may be computed so as to accommodate both variable rates
            and retransmissions, so they might not be fully used at a given
            iteration of the schedule.
            The 6TiSCH architecture provides additional means to avoid waste of
            cells as well as overflows in the transmit bundle, as follows:
         </t>
         <t>
            In one hand, a TX-cell that is not needed for the current iteration
            may be reused opportunistically on a per-hop basis for routed
            packets.
            When all of the frame that were received for a given Track are
            effectively transmitted, any available TX-cell for that Track
            can be reused for upper layer traffic for which the next-hop router
            matches the next hop along the Track. In that case, the cell
            that is being used is effectively a TX-cell from the Track, but the
            short address for the destination is that of the next-hop router.
            It results that a frame that is received in a RX-cell of a Track
            with a destination MAC address set to this node as opposed to
            broadcast must be extracted from the Track and delivered to the
            upper layer (a frame with an unrecognized MAC address is dropped at
            the lower MAC layer and thus is not received at the 6top sublayer).
         </t>
         <t>On the other hand, it might happen that there are not enough
            TX-cells in the transmit bundle to accommodate the Track traffic,
            for instance if more retransmissions are needed than provisioned.
            In that case, the frame can be placed for transmission in the
            bundle that is used for layer-3 traffic towards the next hop along
            the Track as long as it can be routed by the upper layer, that is,
            typically, if the frame transports an IPv6 packet. The MAC address
            should be set to the next-hop MAC address to avoid confusion.
            It results that a frame that is received over a layer-3 bundle may
            be in fact associated to a Track. In a classical IP link such as an
            Ethernet, off-Track traffic is typically in excess over reservation
            to be routed along the non-reserved path based on its QoS setting.
            But with 6TiSCH, since the use of the layer-3 bundle may be due to
            transmission failures, it makes sense for the receiver to recognize
            a frame that should be re-Tracked, and to place it back on the
            appropriate bundle if possible.
            A frame should be re-Tracked if the Per-Hop-Behavior
            group indicated in the Differentiated Services Field in the
            IPv6 header is set to Deterministic Forwarding, as discussed in
            <xref target="pmh"/>.
            A frame is re-Tracked by scheduling it for transmission over the
            transmit bundle associated to the Track,
            with the destination MAC address set to broadcast.
         </t>
         <t>
            There are 2 modes for a Track, transport mode and tunnel mode.
         </t>
         <section title="Transport Mode">
            <t>
               In transport mode, the Protocol Data Unit (PDU) is associated
               with flow-dependant meta-data that refers uniquely to the Track,
               so the 6top sublayer can place the frame in the appropriate cell
               without ambiguity. In the case of IPv6 traffic, this flow
               identification is transported in the Flow Label of the IPv6
               header.
               Associated with the source IPv6 address, the Flow Label forms a
               globally unique identifier for that particular Track that is
               validated at egress before restoring
               the destination MAC address (DMAC) and punting to the upper layer.

               In tunnel mode, the frames originate from an arbitrary protocol 
               over a compatible MAC that may or may not be synchronized with
               the 6TiSCH network. An example of this would be a router with a
               dual radio that is capable of receiving and sending WirelessHART
               or ISA100.11a frames with the second radio, by presenting
               itself as an Access Point or a Backbone Router, respectively.
            </t>
            <t>
               In that mode, some entity (e.g. PCE) can coordinate with a
               WirelessHART Network Manager or an ISA100.11a System Manager to
               specify the flows that are to be transported transparently
               over the Track.

            <t>
               In that case, the flow information that identifies the Track at
               the ingress 6TiSCH router is derived from the RX-cell. The dmac
               is set to this node but the flow information indicates that the
               frame must be tunneled over a particular Track so the frame is
               not passed to the upper layer. Instead, the dmac is forced to
               broadcast and the frame is passed to the 6top sublayer for switching.
            </t>
            <t>
               At the egress 6TiSCH router, the reverse operation occurs. Based
               on metadata associated to the Track, the frame is passed to the
               appropriate link layer with the destination MAC restored.
            </t>
         </section>
         <section title="Tunnel Metadata">
            <t>
               Metadata coming with the Track configuration is expected to provide the destination MAC address
               of the egress endpoint as well as the tunnel mode and specific data depending on the mode,
               for instance a service access point for frame delivery at egress.
               If the tunnel egress point does not have a MAC address that matches the configuration,
               the Track installation fails.
            </t>
            <t>
               In transport mode, if the final layer-3 destination is the tunnel termination, then it is possible
               that the IPv6 address of the destination is compressed at the 6LoWPAN sublayer based on the MAC address.
               It is thus mandatory at the ingress point to validate that the MAC address that was used at the 6LoWPAN
               sublayer for compression matches that of the tunnel egress point. For that reason, the node that injects
               a packet on a Track checks that the destination is effectively that of the tunnel egress point
               before it overwrites it to broadcast.
               The 6top sublayer at the tunnel egress point reverts that operation to the MAC address obtained
               from the tunnel metadata.

	        <xref target="RFC7276"> An Overview of Operations,
            Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Tools</xref> provides an
            overwiew of the existing tooling for OAM <xref target=
            "RFC6291"/>. Tracks are complex paths and new tooling 
            is necessary to manage them, with respect to load control, timing,
            and the Packet Replication and Elimination Functions (PREF).
            
            </t>
            <t>
            An example of such tooling can be found in the context of 
            <xref target="RFC8279">BIER</xref> and more specifically 
            <xref target="I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch">BIER Traffic Engineering</xref>
            (BIER-TE): 
            <xref target="I-D.thubert-bier-replication-elimination"/>
            leverages BIER-TE to control the process of PREF, and to provide
            traceability of these operations, in the deterministic dataplane,
            along a complex Track.
            For the 6TiSCH type of constrained environment, 
            <xref target="I-D.thubert-6lo-bier-dispatch"/> enables an efficient
            encoding of the BIER bitmap within the 6LoRH framework.
