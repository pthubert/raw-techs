The IEEE is an open standardizatoin body participated by technical professional organizations and individuals
with amongst other goals the creation of open standard specifications. The IEEE standardization activities embrace broad technological
areas with the objective to advance technology of the technology for the benefit of humanity.
 
The IEEE802.15.4 Task Group has been driving the development of low-power low-cost radio technology. The Timeslotted
Channel Hopping mode, added to the 2015 revision of the IEEE802.15.4 standard <xref target="IEEE802154"/>, is targeted at the embedded and
industrial world, where reliability, energy consumption and cost drive the application space.
The IEEE802.15.4 physical layer has been designed to support demanding low-power scenarios targeting the use of
unlicensed bands, both the 2.4 GHz and sub GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) bands. This has imposed requirements
in terms of frame size, data rate and bandwidth to achieve reduced collision probability, reduced packet error
rate, and acceptable range with limited transmission power. The PHY layer supports frames of up to 127 bytes. The
Medium Access Control (MAC) sublayer overhead is in the order of 10-20 bytes, leaving about 100 bytes to the upper
layers. IEEE802.15.4 uses spread spectrum modulation such as the Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS).

IPv6 over TSCH is enabled by the work done at the 6TiSCH WG. 
6TiSCH has enabled best effort distributed scheduling to exploit the deterministic access capabilities provided by TSCH. The group designed 
the essential mechanisms to enable the management plane operation while ensuring IPv6 is supported. 
Yet the charter did not focus to providing a solution to establish end to end tracks while meeting quality of service requirements.
6TiSCH, trough the RFC8480 defines the 6P protocol which provides a pairwise negotiation mechanism to the control plane
operation. The protocol supports agreement on a schedule between neighbors, enabling distributed scheduling. 
6P goes hand-in-hand with a Scheduling Function (SF), the policy that decides how to maintain cells and trigger 6P
transactions. The Minimal Scheduling Function (MSF) <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-msf"/> is the default SF defined by the 6TiSCH WG; 
other standardized SFs can be defined in the future. MSF extends the minimal schedule configuration, and is used to add child-parent links
according to the traffic load.

  Time sensitive networking on low power constrained wireless networks have been addressed by ISA100.11a and WirelessHART.

The 6TiSCH architecture <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture"/> already identified diferent models to schedule resources along tracks
exploiting the TSCH schedule structure however these models have not been standardized. 
A Track, in the 6TiSCH architecture is considered a directed path from a source 6TiSCH 
node to one or more destination(s) 6TiSCH node(s) through the 6TiSCH network. A Track in 6TiSCH is the implementation of the
deterministic path in the Detnet architecture [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture]. Along a Track, 6TiSCH nodes reserve the resources to
enable the eficient transmission of packets while aiming to optimize certain properties such as reliability, ensure small jitter or bounded latency. 
The track structure enables Layer-2 forwarding schemes, reducing the overhead of taking routing decisions at the Layer-3. 

Serial Tracks can be understood as the concatenation of cells or bundles along a routing path from a node towards a destination. 
The serial track concept is analogous to the circuit concept where resources are chained through the multi-hop topology. For example
A bundle of Tx Cells in a particular node is paired to a bundle of Rx Cells in the next hop node following a routing path. 

More complex approaches are described in <xref target="I-D.papadopoulos-6tisch-pre-reqs"/> and complemented by extensions to the RPL routing protocol in <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-nsa-extension-01"/>.
Reliability measures are for example achieved by exploiting concepts such as Replication and Elimination. In them, packets at origin are replicated and transmitted along disjoint tracks. 
This redundancy measure exploiting track forwarding increases energy consumption of the network nodes but improves significantly the reliability of the network.

As a core technique in IEEE802.15.4, TSCH splits time
in multiple time slots that repeat over time. The structure is referred
as a Slotframe. For each timeslot, a set of available frequencies
can be used, resulting in a matrix-like schedule (see Fig. <xref target="fig_slotframe"/>).

This schedule represents the possible communications
of a node with its neighbors, and is managed by a Scheduling
Function such as The Minimal Scheduling Function (MSF)  <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-msf"/>.
Each cell in the schedule is identified by its slotoffset and channeloffset coordinates. A
cell's timeslot offset indicates its position in time, relative to the
beginning of the slotframe. A cell's channel offset is an index
which maps to a frequency at each iteration of the slotframe.
Each packet exchanged between neighbors happens within one
cell. An Absolute Slot Number (ASN) indicates the number
of slots elapsed since the network started. It increments at
every slot. This is a 5 byte counter that can support networks
running for more than 300 years without wrapping (assuming
a 10 ms timeslot). Channel hopping provides increased reliability
to multi-path fading and external interference.
It is handled by TSCH through a channel hopping sequence
referred as macHopSeq in the IEEE802.15.4 specification.

  - time synchronization
  - scheduling capabilities, discuss such things as Resource Units, time slots or resource blocks. Can we reserve periodic resources vs. ask each time, what precision can we get in latency control.
  - diversity scenarios, what’s available,
